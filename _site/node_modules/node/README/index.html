<h1>node</h1>
<p>Installs a <code>node</code> binary into your project, which because <code>npm</code> runs scripts with the local <code>./node_modules/.bin</code> in the <code>PATH</code> ahead of the system copy means you can have a local version of node that is different than your system's, and manage node as a normal dependency.</p>
<p>Warning: don't install this globally with npm 2. <code>npm@2</code> immediately removes node, then can't run the scripts that make this work.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<pre><code>npm i node@lts
</code></pre>
<h2>Use with <code>npx</code></h2>
<pre><code>npx node@4 myscript.js
</code></pre>
<p>This will run <code>myscript.js</code> with the latest version of node from the v4 major.</p>
<p>Using the shell auto-fallback of npx, you can even do it like so:</p>
<pre><code>node@4 myscript.js
</code></pre>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>Major thanks to Kat Marchán for late-night problem solving, and to CJ Silverio and Maciej Małecki for egging me on way back when I had the idea to package node up this way. It does turn out if you ask &quot;why <em>not</em>?!&quot; once in a while something fun happens.</p>
